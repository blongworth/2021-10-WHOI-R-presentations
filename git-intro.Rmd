## How many have used:

* Microsoft Word's [Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a), 
* Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en)

Changes are like sequential saves of the document you can return to

If you separate the **changes** from the **document**, you can "play back" different changes on the base document to make different versions of the document.

### If you separate the **changes** from the **document**, you can "play back" different changes on the base document to make different versions of the document.

For example, users can make independent sets of changes on the same document.

### Two sets of changes can be "played back" on to the same base document...

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - then someone has to pick a winner.

## A **version control system** is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us.

### More definitions

* A **commit** is a group of changes to our files stored in version control. Think of it as a "checkpoint" or a "snapshot" that we can go back to later.
* A **repository** is where all the commits and their metadata are stored. There is usually one repository per project, but it can be duplicated and kept in sync on different computers.

* **git** is the version control system we will be using. 

* **GitHub** is a remote system and website where millions of people store, share, and collaborate on copies of their git repositories. This course's, and the Carpentries' websites (including these slides!) are stored as repos on github, and automagically turned into websites.

## Like other tools for Reproducible Data Science, you don't have to go from zero to the Matrix overnight. 

## Using version control effectively can be:

* Using a local git repo to track progress on a project
* Creating a **remote** as a backup
* Adding a **branch** for a new idea
* Inviting collaborators to work on your repo with you
* Modifying an open source project by working with your own **fork** 
* Suggesting a change to an open source project using a **pull request**
