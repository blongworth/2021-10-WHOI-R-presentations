# Introductions

Name, Program and Lab, what you'd like to learn or do with this course

# Pre-course survey
## R is everywhere!

R has great tools for reports, papers, even books and websites. (and presentations!)

No more cutting and pasting figures or forgetting to update data!

---

# Why R, What makes data science reproducible?

* Can you reproduce your analysis?
* How about 5 years later?
* Can a colleague if you send them the data and method/code?
* Can you easily add data and regenerate the analysis? Figures? Report or paper?

# Getting help and giving feedback

We are here to help! Raise your hand an a helper or instructor will message you in the chat. If it can be solved via chat you and the helper will move to a breakout room to talk through the problem.

We'll also ask for input and feedback often. Use "yes" and "no" in the participants window. Coffee break indicator also welcome, but we've got a lot to cover!
